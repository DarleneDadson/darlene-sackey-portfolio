        <p class="project-description">
        In this essay, I will discuss the traditional and spiritual culture of the Tagish First Nations in greater depth, talking about their deep connection to the natural environment and beliefs, as well as how they express these connections through storytelling, traditional medicine, ceremonies, art forms, and customs including clothing and the relation they have for one another</p>

    <main class="project-details"><p>Spirituality is an essential aspect of many people's lives, providing them with a sense of meaning, purpose, and connection to something larger than themselves. Similarly, tradition is an important aspect of many cultures, helping to preserve customs, beliefs, and history for future generations.The Yukon Tagish First Nations have had a rich and unique cultural dynamic for thousands of years that is closely tied to their spirituality and tradition. They make good use of traditional medicine and respect all living things. This connection is expressed through various art styles such as oral storytelling, which serves to gain a better understanding of their beliefs and bring togetherness among their culture.</p>

       <h3> <p>Storytelling for indigenous people marked a symbolic meaningful connection a community and individuals. For indigenous people,storytelling is a traditional method used to teach about cultural beliefs, values, customs, rituals, history, practices, relationships and ways of life</p>
          <p>Angela Sidney (Stoow Choonehte Maa) was a very prominent figure for the Tagish First nations.Angela was a storyteller who was fluent in Tlingit, English, and Tagish</p>
            <p>For Angela, story telling served as teaching moments for all age groups and a way to connect with ancestors and history. She would often tell stories about her family history such as the Klondike Gold Rush and life lessons to children.</p>

          <h3><p>Indigenous people have always saw the natural environment as a scared, important aspect in their life, more than an economic resource. They found the to be an important asset for future generations such as family, the community and all living things involving nature and animals. Indigenous people viewed these connections because the land and living beings are meant to be harmonious.</p>
           <p> The Tagish First Nations were semi-nomadic people and hunted in various places to search for game depending on the season. During the fall season the Tagish would commonly hunt for moose and were very resourceful in using every part of an animal and not to waste anything. They found a lot of use of animal parts to make various tools, tents, boats, snowshoes and clothes.</p>

      <div class="project-image"><img src="assets/photos/medicine-wheel-yukon.jpg"></div>
        <h3><p>The Medicine Wheel is a sacred symbol used by many Indigenous peoples to promote healing, growth, and understanding. It is often depicted as a circle divided into four quadrants, each representing a different aspect of life, such as the four directions, elements, seasons, and stages of life. The wheel is used in ceremonies, teachings, and other cultural practices to help individuals connect with themselves, their communities, and the natural world, and to address social, emotional, physical, and spiritual issues affecting Indigenous peoples. The colours and symbols used in the Medicine Wheel vary depending on the community and teachings.</p>
