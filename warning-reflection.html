        <p class="project-description"> Is Jenny Joseph's poem optimistic as it anticipates an old age, pleasant activities to do
          then and even new attitudes and experiences? Is it reluctant or reticent to think that such
          treats must be delayed until a later date? Is the occasional wearing of purple now
          practice for the future, delaying the inevitable or putting off what could already be
          enjoyed? More broadly, what does the wearing of purple symbolize?

      <h2>
        <p>Ageism is a pervasive phenomenon in society that affects people of all ages, but
        it is more common for older individuals to experience age discrimination due to societal
        expectations. Older people are often treated indifferently, and society places high
        importance on beauty, youthfulness, and productivity, leading to an overall negative
        perception of aging.</p>
        <p> This negative perception of aging can make people wary of the
        future and hesitant to believe that their life will be fulfilling once they grow old.
        Jenny Joseph's short humorous poem "Warning" reflects on the stereotypes of
        older people and the act of going against societal expectations.</p>
        <p>In the poem, Joseph
        declares that she will wear purple and a red hat that does not suit her when she
        becomes an old woman. This line captures her attitude of defying social conventions
        and being free to dress however she pleases for her pleasure and desires. The poem
        presents an optimistic depiction of ageing, as Joseph continues to pursue her
        playful-like side and finds ultimate satisfaction by defying social standards and engaging
        in activities that bring her joy, despite her advanced age.</p>
        <p>The colour purple, which Joseph uses in her poem, signifies playfulness,
        creativity, and grandeur. Wearing purple may express one's creative side and
        self-inspiration, making it a popular colour among younger people. However, Joseph's
        poem describes the defiance of social norms, indicating that age should not limit one's
        ability to express themselves creatively and have fun. Joseph's poem shows that people
        can continue to be creative and playful at any age, and that societal expectations should
        not limit them.</p>
        <p>Joseph's poem challenges the negative stereotypes of ageing and shows that
        people can have a positive outlook on growing old. The verse emphasizes the
        importance of individuality and the freedom to be oneself, regardless of age. In a society
        that often places a high value on conformity and adhering to societal norms, Joseph's
        poem encourages people to embrace their unique qualities and pursue their passions,
        regardless of their age.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Joseph's poem is a reminder that their age or societal expectations
        should not define people. As people age, they often face societal pressure to act a
        certain way or conform to certain expectations. However, Joseph's poem shows that
        people can defy these expectations and be their true selves, regardless of age.</p>
        <p> Joseph's poem encourages people to embrace their inner child and find joy in life's simple
        pleasures, such as wearing a purple outfit with a red hat that does not suit them.
        In conclusion, Jenny Joseph's poem "Warning" provides a humorous and
        optimistic depiction of ageing that challenges negative stereotypes and encourages
        people to be their true selves, regardless of age. </p>
        <p>The poem highlights the importance of
        individuality, creativity, and self-expression and shows that people can continue to find
        joy and fulfillment. Age should not limit one's ability to pursue their passions and be
        happy, and Joseph's poem is a powerful reminder. Ultimately, Joseph's poem celebrates
        the life and inspires people to live their lives to the fullest, regardless of age.</p></h2>
