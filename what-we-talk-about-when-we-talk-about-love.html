        <p class="project-description"> In Carver's story some of the characters state their opinion that violent behaviors like assault and suicide can be  expressions of love. How do they back up this idea? Do you think this idea has some merit or not?. This short  story by Raymond Carver is about 4 couples discuss their idea of what love means to them

	<p>Love among people brings passion, intimacy and commitment that strengthens the bond in a loving relationship. Love in itself is subjective; many people's relationships display love differently, such as through gift-giving, acts of service, spending time together, and words of affirmation. On the other spectrum, some people display counterproductive methods such as physical abuse, verbal abuse and manipulation in disguise as love to gain control, thus making the victim rationalize by feeling bad or sympathize with these negative counterproductive behaviours of the abuser because it has become their reality.</p>
    <p> This is true for Terri in Raymond Carver’s story,  “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.” A story about four couples casually chatting and discussing their idea of what love is. Terri is the wife of Mel, a cardiologist, and both have opposing views on what love is. For  Terri, she recounts the time when her ex-boyfriend, Ed, physically assaulted her and committed suicide in the name of love. However, Ed put emotional and physical distress on Terri, which in turn affected her relationship with Mel as they both had to witness and be part of Ed’s erratic behaviour as threatening the couple. Terri feels a form of remorse and empathy for Ed, and for her, she understands his actions as love because he said he loved her.

      <p>True genuine love for another person requires empathy, trust, and mutual respect, as well as displays of love that are positive and productive in the relationship. The cycle of an abusive relationship begins with excessive displays of love and affection that give the victim a false sense of security while concealing the unhealthy nature of the relationship. The abuser then uses gaslighting to bring the victim down by lying, denying, and distorting the relationship's reality in a way that makes the victim confused and vulnerable to the relationship's negative realities. In this case, Terri feels sorry for Ed and excuses his actions due to the complexity of the abuse she endured.</p>
        <p>It is important to point out the idea of one's expression of what love means to them. Love can mean many different things to people, shown in various forms of self-expression. Yet, in this case, with Terri and the retelling of her relationship with Ed, she fails to understand the difference between manipulation and love, which is the cause of being a victim of abuse.</p>
          <p>This idea does hold a lot of value in digesting one’s thoughts of what they consider love means because the meaning of love to anyone is compiled through experiences, preferences and expectations and in this case, for Carver’s character Terri, we can see what an unhealthy destructive relationship looks like. That love was not really in the mind of Ed but it was the manipulation, love-bombing and violent behaviours to excuse as love.</p>
